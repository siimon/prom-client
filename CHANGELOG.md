## [Unreleased]

### Breaking

### Changed

### Added

## [13.1.0] - 2021-01-24

### Changed

- fix: push client attempting to write Promise (fixes [#390](https://github.com/siimon/prom-client/issues/390))
- types: improve type checking of labels
- fix: Summary#observe should throw when adding additional labels to labelset (fixes [#262](https://github.com/siimon/prom-client/issues/262))

### Added

- feat: added the ability to pass labels as an object to `labels()` and `remove()`
- Added: More examples with commented output

## [13.0.0] - 2020-12-16

### Breaking

- changed: The following functions are now async (return a promise):
  `registry.metrics()`
  `registry.getMetricsAsJSON()`
  `registry.getMetricsAsArray()`
  `registry.getSingleMetricAsString()`

  If your metrics server has a line like `res.send(register.metrics())`, you
  should change it to `res.send(await register.metrics())`.

  Additionally, all metric types now accept an optional `collect` function,
  which is called when the metric's value should be collected and within which
  you should set the metric's value. You should provide a `collect` function for
  point-in-time metrics (e.g. current memory usage, as opposed to HTTP request
  durations that are continuously logged in a histogram).

- changed: `register.clusterMetrics()` no longer accepts a callback; it only
  returns a promise.

- removed: v12.0.0 added the undocumented functions `registry.registerCollector`
  and `registry.collectors()`. These have been removed. If you were using them,
  you should instead provide a `collect` function as described above.

### Changed

- fix: provide nodejs_version_info metric value after calling `registry.resetMetrics()` (#238)
- fix: provide process_max_fds metric value after calling `registry.resetMetrics()`
- fix: provide process_start_time_seconds metric value after calling `registry.resetMetrics()`
- chore: improve performance of `registry.getMetricAsPrometheusString`
- chore: refactor metrics to reduce code duplication
- chore: replace `utils.getPropertiesFromObj` with `Object.values`
- chore: remove unused `catch` bindings
- chore: upgrade Prettier to 2.x
- fix: startTimer returns `number` in typescript instead of `void`
- fix: incorrect typings of `registry.getSingleMetric' (#388)
- chore: stop testing node v13 on CI

### Added

- feat: exposed `registry.registerCollector()` and `registry.collectors()` methods in TypeScript declaration
- Added: complete working example of a pushgateway push in `example/pushgateway.js`
- feat: added support for adding labels to default metrics (#374)
- Added CHANGELOG reminder

## [12.0.0] - 2020-02-20

### Breaking

- Dropped support for end-of-life Node.js versions 6.x and 8.x
- Dropped the previously deprecated support for positional parameters in
  constructors, only the config object forms remain.
- Default metrics are collected on scrape of metrics endpoint, not on an
  interval. The `timeout` option to `collectDefaultMetrics(conf)` is no longer
  supported or needed, and the function no longer returns a `Timeout` object.

### Changed

- chore: remove ignored package-lock.json
- fix: `process_max_fds` is process limit, not OS (#314)
- Changed `Metric` labelNames & labelValues in TypeScript declaration to a generic type `T extends string`, instead of `string`
- Lazy-load Node.js Cluster module to fix Passenger support (#293)
- fix: avoid mutation bug in `registry.getMetricsAsJSON()`
- fix: improve performance of `registry.getMetrics*`
- End function of histogram `startTimer`, when invoked returns the number of seconds
- chore: reindent package.json
- chore: correct var name in processStartTime
- chore: add test for `process_start_time_seconds`
- chore: spelling corrections in README

### Added

- feat: implement GC metrics collection without native(C++) modules.
- feat: implement advanced event loop monitoring

## [11.5.3] - 2019-06-27

## [11.4.0] - 2019-06-04

### Added
